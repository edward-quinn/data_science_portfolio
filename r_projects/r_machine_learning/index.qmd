# Predicting Diabetes

One of the most exciting applications of machine learning is in the prediction of disease states. Here, I demonstrate the use of the newest modeling framework in R to compare many different types of models in the prediction of diabetes.

The data come from citation and link to full citation footnote. 

Let's load our libraries.

```{r}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidymodels))
tidymodels_prefer()

```


Read in the data from Github

```{r}
