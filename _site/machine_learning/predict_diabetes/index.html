<p>One of the most exciting applications of machine learning is in the prediction of disease states. Here, I build a random forest classifier using a modeling framework in R called <a href="https://tidymodels.tidymodels.org">tidymodels</a>. The random forest model will be tuned to predict diabetes diagnosis within five years.</p>
</section><section id="the-data" class="level1"><h1>The Data</h1>
<p>The data come from the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases <span class="citation" data-cites="smith1988">(<a href="#ref-smith1988" role="doc-biblioref">Smith et al. 1988</a>)</span>. There are 768 Pima Indian women included in the data set. Here’s a list of the variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Pregnancies</code> - Number of pregnancies</p></li>
<li><p><code>Glucose</code> - Plasma glucose in mg/dl two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test</p></li>
<li><p><code>BloodPressure</code> - Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg</p></li>
<li><p><code>SkinThickness</code> - Triceps skinfold thickness; a measure of body fat</p></li>
<li><p><code>Insulin</code> - Two hour serum insulin</p></li>
<li><p><code>BMI</code> - Body mass index</p></li>
<li><p><code>DiabetesPedigreeFunction</code> - A measure of family history of diabetes</p></li>
<li><p><code>Age</code> - Measured in years</p></li>
<li><p><code>Outcome</code> - An indicator variable for diabetes diagnosis</p></li>

<p>It is clear clicking on the filtering icons next to each variable name that there are some impossible values. For example, there are people with a BMI of zero. It is likely that missing values are encoded with a zero, so let’s set values of zero for the variables <code>Glucose</code>, <code>BloodPressure</code>, <code>Insulin</code>, <code>BMI</code>, and <code>SkinThickness</code> equal to <code>NA</code> to indicate missingness.</p>

<p>Some columns have very few missing values, such as <code>Glucose</code>, while others, such as <code>Insulin</code>, have a very high proportion of missing values. Predictors typically cannot have missing values in machine learning applications, so we will need to estimate these missing values in our analysis pipeline.</p>

<p>Our accuracy is 80.2%. This an improvement over the simplest model, which would consist of guessing that no one will develop diabetes. The simple model would have 65.1% accuracy, so our first pass at a random forest model does represent an improvement in accuracy over the simple model. One thing we need to check is the stability of our measure of accuracy, which could be sensitive to the random seed we used. Let’s set up 5-fold cross validation (repeated 5 times) to get a more stable estimate of the accuracy of the random forest model.</p>

<p>Cross validation suggests that a more stable estimate of the accuracy of our model would be 75.8%, which is still an improvement over guessing that no one will be diagnosed with diabetes within the next five years.</p>
<p>Why the drop in accuracy? This may be due to the necessarily small sample sizes in the analysis folds used in each cross validation iteration.</p>
<p>What can we do to improve the accuracy of our model? There are several parameters of a random forest model that can be tuned, including <code>mtry</code>, <code>trees</code>, and <code>min_n</code>. Let’s try tuning to see if we can improve upon 75.8% accuracy.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, <code>Glucose</code> is the most important variable in predicting onset of diabetes. That’s reassuring since diabetes is diagnosed using glucose levels!</p>
</section><section id="next-steps" class="level1"><h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>This is a very rough first pass at predicting onset of diabetes using a random forest machine learning model. We could try to improve accuracy in the test set with additional feature engineering, tinkering with preprocessing steps, and using expanded grids when tuning parameters. That’s all for now!</p>
