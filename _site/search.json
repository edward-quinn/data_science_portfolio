    "text": "Introduction\nOne of the most exciting applications of machine learning is in the prediction of disease states. Here, I demonstrate the use of a new modeling framework in R called tidymodels to compare multiple different types of machine learning models in their prediction of diabetes.\nThe Data\nThe data come from the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Smith et al. 1988). There are 768 Pima Indian women included in the data set. Here’s a list of the variables:\n\nPregnancies - Number of pregnancies\nGlucose - Plasma glucose in mg/dl two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test\nBloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg\nSkinThickness - Triceps skinfold thickness; a measure of body fat\nInsulin - Two hour serum insulin\nBMI - Body mass index\nDiabetesPedigreeFunction - A measure of family history of diabetes\nAge - Measured in years\nOutcome - An indicator variable for diabetes diagnosis\nExploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s load our libraries.\n\nCodesuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidymodels))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(RCurl))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GGally))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(DT))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(here))\n\n\ntidymodels_prefer()\n\n\nRead in the data and take a look at the numbers Table 1.\n\nCodedf &lt;- read_csv(here(\"r_projects/r_machine_learning/diabetes.csv\"))\n\ndatatable(df)\n\n\nTable 1: Raw Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear clicking on the filtering icons next to each variable name that there are some impossible values. For example, there are people with a BMI of zero. It is likely that missing values are encoded with a zero, and this will need to be addressed later. Also, note that the outcome is encoded as 0 (no diabetes) and 1 (diabetes). Let’s change this variable to a factor in R, so that it is interpreted as a binary variable.\n\nCodedf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  mutate(Outcome = factor(Outcome, levels = c(0,1),\n                          labels = c(\"No Diabetes\",\"Diabetes\")))\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to visualize the data as part of exploratory data analysis.\n\nCodeggpairs(df)\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(df, aes(Age, BMI)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeplot(1:10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSmith, Jack W., J.
